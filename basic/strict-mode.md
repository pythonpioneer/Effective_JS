## Strict Mode in JavaScript

### Important Note

- Decide which versions of JavaScript your application supports.
- Be sure that any JavaScript features you use are supported by all environments where your application runs.
- Always test strict code in environments that perform the strict- mode checks.
- Beware of concatenating scripts that differ in their expectations about strict mode.
